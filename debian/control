Description: GRUB gfxpayload blacklist
 The 'set gfxpayload=keep' facility in GRUB provides smooth graphical
 handover to the Linux kernel.  Unfortunately, this does not work on all
 systems, resulting in a black or corrupt display.  This package provides a
 blacklist of PCI IDs which fail.
 .
 We maintain this separately from GRUB because it is likely to be updated on
 a different schedule.
